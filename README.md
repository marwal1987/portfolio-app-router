### About me:

I am an enthusiastic developer with an understanding of both frontend development and Linux DevOps. With experience using technologies such as Ansible, Docker, AWS, and GCP, as well as implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitLab and GitHub Actions, I have in other words gathered knowledge within a broad technical skill set.

### Education and Experience:

I'm currently studying frontend development and have hands-on experience with HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux Toolkit, React Native, SEO, CRO.

My previous education in Linux DevOps has given me foundational knowledge in several areas that may come in handy, including Linux, Ansible, Docker, VMware, and cloud management.

### Goals and Ambitions:

As part of my education, I’m seeking an internship (LIA), where I can continue to grow in the fields of technology.

### Other interests:

The wonders of nature and music are important parts of my life, and if there’s a chance to combine these passions with my technical skills, it would be a perfect match.
